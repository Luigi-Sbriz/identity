# Sustainable Digital Identity Trust Schema

For the effectiveness of the identity trust system based on the paradigm of trust towards a third party recognizable as reliable, it is necessary to guarantee a transparent and verifiable mechanism. The objective is to achieve universal participation and it is only possible if trust in the system as a whole is demonstrable. For this reason it is necessary to establish founding principles that guide the rules to guarantee equal dignity and balance in all components of the system. The following nine principles are established:

1. The digital identity can be cancelled or deleted without impacting the physical identity.
2. The digital identity must be linkable to the physical identity in a verifiable manner.
3. Only the authority that legally manages the individual's physical identity can verify this link.
4. The authentication system must be flexible (i.e., able to adapt to technological evolutions or emerging needs).
5. The authentication system must be accessible to all potential users (i.e., without discriminatory costs).
6. The authentication system must be secure (i.e., continuously aligned with security best practices).
7. The authentication system must be privacy-friendly (i.e., not requiring any personal information unless strictly necessary).
8. The authentication system must be resilient (i.e., with availability appropriate for needs and the ability to cope with adversity).
9. The authentication system technology must be open (i.e., able to evolve based on transparent shared standards and verifiable developments).

To guarantee the principles set out, the requirements of the authentication system MUST include the protection of personal data and the guarantee of anonymity for lawful purposes, that is:

1. Ensure mutual recognition to guarantee the identity of the provider to the consumer.
2. Ensure the ability to authenticate the digital identities of consumers and providers against their real-world identity, without unnecessarily exposing real data.

The ability to validate the authenticity of the relationship between digital identity and physical identity lies only with the public authority responsible for managing the citizen's identity. This capability is provided through a digital identity recognition service (i.e. IdC), technologically compliant with identity provider protocols but under the supervision of the public authority.
