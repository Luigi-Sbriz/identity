# Identity Provider - Trustee Concept

The symmetric authentication protocol bases its functioning on the existence of trusted entities, called ***identity providers (IdPs)***, in a network among themselves, exchanging authentication messages to guarantee the digital identity. Each IdP acts as a point of reference for the identity authentication service in its digital ecosystem, and must be able to communicate with every other IdP to recognize identities belonging to other ecosystems, securely from intrusions or tampering. The effectiveness of the entire authentication system depends on the trust placed in these identity providers but it must be deserved. This requires a robust organisation, subject to systematic oversight by independent certification body, to ensure transparent management by IdPs.

## Importance of this role

The identity provider is the guarantor of the authenticity of the relationship between digital credentials and the identity of natural or legal persons in digital communication. For this role it can also be called an **ID trustee** and the greatest criticality it must face is the inviolability of the messages exchanged. Furthermore, when processing personal data, the laws of the country to which the data subject belongs must be considered. It may also provide additional services (e.g. anonymous email, answering machine, anonymous accounts,...), but always in full compliance with the applicable law and only if they do not present risk for the data subject. Anonymization services are intended exclusively for the intended recipient but not for the authority exercising the applicable law (e.g. for a whistleblowing).

An IdP MUST be a legal person subject to both the laws of the country to which it belongs and to international certification bodies, to guarantee compliance with this standard, the security of the information processed, the expected level of quality of service and the lawful processing of data.

## Infrastructure

The infrastructure underlying symmetric communication is a dedicated network to the exchange of authentication messages between IdPs. Ideally, each IdP always has two connectors, one to communicate with its trusted entity and the other to exchange messages with another IdP. With its own entity the mechanism is exactly the one defined by [RFC6749]. With other IdPs, a reserved channel is required for the exchange of tokens, which provides guarantees on the integrity of the messages and their origin. This channel SHOULD have low latency because it represents an additional step compared to the single ecosystem authentication scheme. The intended mechanism for sharing messages is that of a mail server [RFC5321].

The dedicated network for the identity providers is not technically necessary for the authentication protocol but is essential for security, to reduce the risk of fraud or identity theft and, to ensure trust in lawful behavior. There MUST also be an international control body for the IdPs and the IdP network, an authority with the task of governing the overall system, i.e. defining technical standards, or carrying out audits to ensure compliance with the rules, or acting to exclude nodes in case of violation of the rules.
